title: Lidars and Cameras
---

A `LidarsAndCameras` input consists of a *single* frame which contains 1-9 cameras images as well as a single pointcloud. For more documentation on what each field corresponds to in the `LidarsAndCameras` object please check the section related to [Input Overview](/docs/input-api/overview).


```python reference
https://github.com/annotell/annotell-python/blob/master/annotell-input-api/examples/lidars_and_cameras.py
```

:::tip Use dryrun to validate input
Setting `dryrun` parameter to true in the method call, will validate the input using the Input API but not create any inputs.
