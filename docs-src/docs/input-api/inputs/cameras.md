title: Cameras
---
A `Cameras` input consists of a single frame of camera images, where the frame can contain between 1-8 images from different sensors. For more documentation on what each field corresponds to in the `Cameras` object please check the section related to [Input Overview](/docs/input-api/overview).

```python reference
https://github.com/annotell/annotell-python/blob/master/annotell-input-api/examples/cameras.py
```

:::tip Use dryrun to validate input
Setting `dryrun` parameter to true in the method call, will validate the input using the Input API but not create any inputs.
